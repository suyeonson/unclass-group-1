				Both history and medicine contribute tying contraception to gender. Lisa Wade, chair of the sociology department of Occidental College in Los Angeles, said social forces drive the one-sidedness, leaving women largely responsible for contraception.
			</p>
			<p> 
				"For both biological and social reasons, we are much more comfortable with intervening with women's body," she said. "It makes sense to modify the female body for social purposes. We hold men's to be more sacred."
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Brandon Hill, a behavioral scientist in contraceptive and family planning at the University of Chicago, agrees. 
			</p>
			<p>
	 			"It's a huge cultural shift to say men should have a part in the discussion," Hill said. "There are larger social discourse that genders birth control to women historically."

				When it comes to contraception education, where the conversation happens matters a great deal. Most happen within the walls of an OB-GYN's office, effectively keeping men out of the conversation completely. Historically, it has been a women's reproductive health issue, with no corresponding specialty for men to ask questions of their doctors.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Men have little knowledge about how [contraceptives] work but lots of opinions," he said. "We only counsel one-half of the scenario, but the influence of partners is clearly there."
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite gaps in knowledge for many men, Hill said female patients often want to consult their partners before making a decision. Men should not be excluded from the conversation but welcomed into it.
			</p>
			<p>
				"There is a knowledge gap where we can intervene," he said. "It needs to be treated as a couple decision. Keeping contraception dyadic or 'couple level.' Most care is done at an individual level, but decisions are made on a couple level. So, it's about creating sexual health communication between partners."
			</p>
			<p>
				Petrina LaFaire is a member of Northwestern University's Sexual Health and Assault Peer Educators, which educates and facilitates discussions about sexual topics ranging from sexual assault to contraceptive use.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Talking about birth control and deciding on the best method can be a tricky and sensitive issue for a couple," she said, "The issue is often complicated further due to unequal understanding and information. Most current birth control methods rely primarily on the female, so men often don't understand the options available or the implications for their partner's decision to use them."
			</p>
			<p>
				LaFaire said SHAPE educators are trained to facilitate discussion and create an open space to talk for individuals and couples. 
			</p> 
			<p>
				"Whenever I talk to guys about this stuff, I pose it to them as, 'If you had the option of using birth control, how would you take it? What responsibilities would you have?'" LaFaire said, "A lot of times guys just think birth control is a magic pill that just means they can't have a baby and don't have to use a condom."

				"Condoms have been overly branded as STI prevention, which they do, but most don't consider it contraception," Hill said. "That's not what they have been sold as."
			</p>
			<p> 
				Because condoms are more closely associated with preventing sexually transmitted infections, many long-term couples stop using them once they become monogamous.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I think a lot of young men just don't think about it at all," Wade said. "I'll see these stories where she said she's using the pill so they didn't use a condom. This tells me, because they're excited not to use a condom, they never have anything more to say about that. They're trusting her words that she is on birth control and no further discussion is needed."

				The unequal information and unequal responsibility of birth control methods, an issue that so greatly affects both parties in a relationship, makes for complex power dynamics within the relationship.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Since women generally assume the majority of the responsibility due to the effectiveness and availability of female hormonal birth control pills, the woman usually makes the initial decision about birth control methods based on what works best for her body.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's tough because it's really important for a girl to figure out the right kind of birth control on her own, but she still has to consult her partner about it," said LaFaire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Conversations within a couple regarding birth control can be difficult, Hill said, particularly because they tend to evoke sensitive questions about each partner's role in the relationship.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Gender dynamics are not equal power structures. There is a potential for a male to influence regardless of his level of knowledge," said Hill, "It can skew female partners' decision, adherence and continuation."

				With power dynamics and responsibility at a large gender imbalance, many have turned to the possibility of male hormonal birth control options. While rumors of male hormonal birth control pills have circulated for years, however, no universally accepted option has surfaced.
			</p>
			<p> 
				Brian Nguyen, an OB-GYN at Oregon Health and Science University going into a fellowship in family planning, says there’s a reason for that, and it starts with the pharmaceutical companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The problem with research in involving men in reproductive health care is that there isn't really a profit interest in it," Nguyen said, "If there's already female methods, why enter a field that's so new and so filled with risk, in terms of potentially causing danger to men, when they are otherwise healthy? That's the biggest barrier in getting male methods out."
			</p>
			<p>
				Another barrier to male contraceptive involvement, according to Nguyen, lies with public policy. Nguyen pointed out that the passing of the Affordable Care Act lead to a mandate that insurance carriers provide contraceptive pills free of cost to all women since the cost of an unplanned pregnancy is so high. The bill, however, made no mention of male contraceptive methods, leaving condoms or other male preventional methods out, effectively cutting men out of the contraceptive conversation, even though they, too, would shoulder the cost of an unplanned pregnancy.
			</p>
			<p>
				"There's a lot of deep-seated bias towards making reproductive care more female-centric than male-centric," said Nguyen, "If you want to ensure equal power dynamics, you have to make sure there's equal access."
			</p>
			<p>
				Nguyen said he is determined to help bring men into the conversation when it comes to contraception and family planning, but he believes a lot needs to change for that to happen, including increased education for men on contraceptive options both male and female.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Male involvement has to be part of the dialogue early, early on," said Nguyen. "Men have to have this education, and we as a population have to care to ensure that men have it and believe that it's valuable."
