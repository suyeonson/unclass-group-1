			Both history and medicine contribute tying contraception to gender. Lisa Wade, chair of the sociology department of Occidental College in Los Angeles, said social forces drive the one-sidedness, leaving women largely responsible for contraception.
		</p>
		<p> 
			"For both biological and social reasons, we are much more comfortable with intervening with women's body," she said. "It makes sense to modify the female body for social purposes. We hold men's to be more sacred."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I think historically the burden's always been on the women. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that in case of pregnancy, ultimately, the assumption is that the woman's going to have to deal with it, so she better be the one to take care of it."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hill agrees.
		</p>
		<p>
 			"It's a huge cultural shift to say men should have a part in the discussion," Hill said. "There are larger social discourse that genders birth control to women historically.""

			Petrina LaFaire is a member of Northwestern University's Sexual Health and Assault Peer Educators, which educates and facilitates discussions about sexual topics ranging from sexual assault to contraceptive use.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Talking about birth control and deciding on the best method can be a tricky and sensitive issue for a couple," she said, "The issue is often complicated further due to unequal understanding and information. Most current birth control methods rely primarily on the female, so men often don't understand the options available or the implications for their partner’s decision to use them."
		</p>
		<p>
			LaFaire said SHAPE educators are trained to facilitate discussion and create an open space to talk for individuals and couples. 
		</p> 
		<p>
			"Whenever I talk to guys about this stuff, I pose it to them as, 'If you had the option of using birth control, how would you take it? What responsibilities would you have?'" LaFaire said, "A lot of times guys just think birth control is a magic pill that just means they can't have a baby and don't have to use a condom."
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite gaps in knowledge for many men, Hill said female patients often want to consult their partners before making a decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Men have little knowledge about how [contraceptives] work but lots of opinions," he said. "We only counsel one-half of the scenario, but the influence of partners is clearly there."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hill agrees, adding that men should not be excluded from the conversation but welcomed into it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"There is a knowledge gap where we can intervene," he said. "It needs to be treated as a couple decision. Keeping contraception dyadic or 'couple level.' Most care is done at an individual level, but decisions are made on a couple level. So, it's about creating sexual health communication between partners."

			"Condoms have been overly branded as STI prevention, which they do, but most don’t consider it contraception," Hill said. "That's not what they have been sold as." 
		</p>
		<p>
			Because condoms are more closely associated with preventing sexually transmitted infections, many long-term couples stop using them once they become monogamous. 
		</p>
		<p>
			"I think a lot of young men just don't think about it at all," Wade said. "I'll see this stories where she said she's using the pill so they didn't use a condom. This tells me, because they're excited not to use a condom, they never have anything more to say about that. They're trusting her words that she is on birth control and no further discussion is needed."

			The unequal information and unequal responsibility of birth control methods, an issue that so greatly affects both parties in a relationship, makes for complex power dynamics within the relationship. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Since women generally assume the majority of the responsibility due to the effectiveness and availability of female hormonal birth control pills, the woman usually makes the initial decision about birth control methods based on what works best for her body. 
		</p>
		<p>
			"It's tough because it's really important for a girl to figure out the right kind of birth control on her own, but she still has to consult her partner about it," said LaFaire.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conversations within a couple regarding birth control can be difficult, Hill said, particularly because they tend to evoke sensitive questions about each partner’s role in the relationship.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Gender dynamics are not equal power structures. There is a potential for a male to influence regardless of his level of knowledge," said Hill, "It can skew female partners' decision, adherence and continuation."
